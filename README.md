# Weather App
The weather widget LWC is available on all Lightning Pages. You can add it to the page using the App Builder. 
Before using the app in your own org you have to ensure that you have set up the Endpoint and API Key in organization default custom settings. 
The Endpoint should be: http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key={0}&q={1}	

For non-admin users you have to assign them a permission set Weather API.
